# Skripsi

This is my final project repository as a college student from
Telkom University.
I have an interest in natural language processing so I decided to write
something.
The title is **CCGtown: A Web-based Semi-automatic Combinatory Categorial**
**Grammar (CCG) Annotation Tool**.
It is written in bahasa Indonesia.
As for the English version, it will be coming up later on the different
repository.

**Status**: **Draft**

The preview is available on [tex/main.pdf](tex/main.pdf).

**Notes**:
The project structure is messy, I know.
I will tidy it up later.
